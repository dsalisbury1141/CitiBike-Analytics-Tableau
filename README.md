#  CitiBike Phenomena's for mothe September 2019 & 2020 comparison
My evaluations were based on two months of data, September 2019, and September 2020.  I chose these months to measure the difference in subscribers and ridership before and during the covid lockdowns within this NY city area for CitiBike ridership.</li>

#The data was extremely large and forced me to evaluate each month separately in 2 different dashboards.  Please refer to each dashboard for grading purposes.  Also, I will summarize my GitHub repository.
